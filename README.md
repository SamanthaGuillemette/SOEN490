# Xplore

This project is a part of SOEN 490 - Capstone Software Engineering Design Project - at Concordia University. 

### Problem Statement
Given the rapidly changing landscape of the software industry, a developer must take on the role of a lifelong learner to develop the skills and knowledge base necessary to excel in the field. In order to bridge the gap between a student's skills and expected performance in industry, a platform which facilitates the rapid development of new skills is crucial.
### Proposed Solution
Defined as a collaborative project-based learning platform, Xplore is an upcoming application that facilitates learning programming technologies (languages, frameworks, infrastructure services, etc.) using project-based learning. The application focuses on the creation of projects by either a user or a group of users which can later be shared within the community.
### Differentiator
### Project Details
With each project, the user has the opportunity to learn and apply knowledge simultaneously which ultimately decreases the time spent learning. In addition to providing comprehensive and unique learning outcomes, users exit projects with a completed product that can be used to demonstrate competence in the technologies they chose to work with. Rather than listing each project on their resume, the application allows a user to personalize their profile by adding their skills and projects of choice. The user can later share their profile as a link to recruiters.
